# college_cpp_course

I took this class my sophomore year at the University of South Carolina. This it the code I had to write for the class.

In the introductory class before this class, we were instructed to code C++ in VIM. However, I didn't like this and learned about Sublime Text Editor. This is what I used for this code.
