# CPP-U_of_SC_2015-2016

I took this class my sophomore year at the University of South Carolina. This it the code I had to write for the class.

In the introductory class before this class, we were instructed to code C++ in VIM. However, I didn't like this and learned about Sublime Text Editor. This is what I used for this code.

**Any files labeled hw#testdirectory are the original files. The PDF is the instructions for the assignment. I had to turn in a tar.gz file, which is included in the folders. I also unzipped the file so that the files may be viewable on this website.**
